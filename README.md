## Shop with Users OOP System

This is a TypeScript project that implements an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) system for a shop with users who can buy items. It provides classes for Item, User, and Shop, along with various methods for managing the user's cart and performing cart operations.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal in the project's root directory.

3. Initialize the Node.js Project

   Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

```
npm init -y
```

4. Install TypeScript
